# README Generator

I created this generator using inquirer.

When you enter in node index.js int the terminal, you are prompted for information about your project.
You will also be asked to select a license from a list.
Once you completed entering in your information for your project, your README file is ready.

You will be able to see the badge for the license on your README, and your email and Github link will be available.

When you click a link in the Table Of Contents it will bring you down to the area you are looking for.
